[![MetaCPAN Release](https://badge.fury.io/pl/vars-i.svg)](https://metacpan.org/release/vars-i)
# NAME

vars::i - Perl pragma to declare and simultaneously initialize global variables.

# SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Dumper;
    $Data::Dumper::Deparse = 1;

    use vars::i '$VERSION' => 3.44;
    use vars::i '@BORG' => 6 .. 6;
    use vars::i '%BORD' => 1 .. 10;
    use vars::i '&VERSION' => sub(){rand 20};
    use vars::i '*SOUTH' => *STDOUT;

    BEGIN {
        print SOUTH Dumper [
            $VERSION, \@BORG, \%BORD, \&VERSION
        ];
    }

    use vars::i [ # has the same effect as the 5 use statements above
        '$VERSION' => 3.66,
        '@BORG' => [6 .. 6],
        '%BORD' => {1 .. 10},
        '&VERSION' => sub(){rand 20},
        '*SOUTH' => *STDOUT,
    ];

    print SOUTH Dumper [ $VERSION, \@BORG, \%BORD, \&VERSION ];

# DESCRIPTION

For whatever reason, I once had to write something like

    BEGIN {
        use vars '$VERSION';
        $VERSION = 3;
    }

or

    our $VERSION;
    BEGIN { $VERSION = 3; }

and I really didn't like typing that much.  With this package, I can say:

    use vars::i '$VERSION' => 3;

and get the same effect.

Also, I like being able to say

    use vars::i '$VERSION' => sprintf("%d.%02d", q$Revision: 1.3 $ =~ /: (\d+)\.(\d+)/);

    use vars::i [
     '$VERSION' => sprintf("%d.%02d", q$Revision: 1.3 $ =~ /: (\d+)\.(\d+)/),
     '$REVISION'=> '$Id: GENERIC.pm,v 1.3 2002/06/02 11:12:38 _ Exp $',
    ];

Like with `use vars;`, there is no need to fully qualify the variable name.
However, you may if you wish.

# NOTES

- Specifying a variable but not a value will succeed silently, and will **not**
create the variable.  E.g., `use vars::i '$foo';` is a no-op.
- Trying to create a special variable is fatal.  E.g., `use vars::i '$@', 1;`
will die at compile time.

# SEE ALSO

See [vars](https://metacpan.org/pod/vars), ["our" in perldoc](https://metacpan.org/pod/perldoc#our), ["Pragmatic Modules" in perlmodlib](https://metacpan.org/pod/perlmodlib#Pragmatic-Modules).

# MINIMUM PERL VERSION

This version supports Perl 5.6+.  If you are running an earlier Perl,
use version 1.01 of this module (PODMASTER/vars-i-1.01).

# DEVELOPMENT

This module uses [Minilla](https://metacpan.org/pod/Minilla) for release management.  When developing, you
can use normal `prove -l` for testing based on the files in `lib/`.  Before
submitting a pull request, please:

- make sure all tests pass under `minil test`
- update the `Changes` file
- update the `.mailmap` file to list your PAUSE user ID if you have one, and
if your git commits are not under your `@cpan.org` email.  That way you will
be properly listed as a contributor in MetaCPAN.
